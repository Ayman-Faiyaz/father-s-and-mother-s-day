Your love, support, and guidance have shaped us into the people we are today. You've always been there for us, through every challenge and every triumph, and we can't express how grateful we are for all you've done.</p>
                        
                        <p>Thank you for all the sacrifices you've made and the endless encouragement you've given us. Your wisdom and strength are a constant source of motivation, and we strive every day to make you proud.</p>

                        <p>Here's to celebrating you, Mom and Dad. You mean the world to us, and we hope this day brings you as much joy and happiness as you have brought into our lives.</p>
